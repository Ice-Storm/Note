Reflection and Mataprogramming
================================

Ruby is a very dynamic language; you can insert new methods into classes at runtime, create aliases for exiting methods, and even define methods on individual objects. In addition, it has a rich API for reflection. Reflection, also called introspection, simply means that a program can examine its state and its structure.
